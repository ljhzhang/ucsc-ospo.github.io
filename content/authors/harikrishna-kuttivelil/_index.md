Harikrishna (Hari) Kuttivelil is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Engineering working under Dr. Katia Obraczka with the Inter-Networking Research Group (i-NRG) at UCSC. His thesis research explores the potential to optimize and democratize machine learning by enabling responsible and efficient collaborative intelligence between edge devices (like phones or sensors) without having to rely on centralized compute. He has worked with many open source frameworks within deep learning and network simulation. His research necessitated him to co-create NSB, giving him the opportunity to participate in the NSF I-Corps training program as part of a NSF POSE award. Hari has also been a pedagogy fellow to explore, develop, and teach active learning techniques and universal design principles to address gaps in higher education. In both his teaching and research, Hari is motivated by a belief that both technology and education should be sustainable, equitable, and democratized.
