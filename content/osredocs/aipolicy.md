# General AI Use Policy for Contributions to OSRE Affiliated Projects
*Note that individual projects and mentor teams may have their own policy with regards to AI tools that go beyond the expectations set below. When in conflict, project specific policies supersede these general OSRE guidelines.* 

While the administrators of the OSRE permit some use of AI/ML tools that help contributors improve efficiency and productivity, we do not condone the use of these tools as a replacement for **necessary technical skill, personal judgment, or individual accountability**.  

All contributors are fully responsible for each line of code or other contributions they make to one of our projects.  Therefore, for all aspects of your contributions you must – without the assistance of AI – be able to:
* Fully explain (including in live discussions with mentors) the process you took to make the contribution; 
* Defend the value and correctness of the contribution/code you submitted;  and 
* Make modifications to the contribution based on critiques/feedback from the community.

If you are unable to confidently meet these three expectations then you should not be submitting the related code/contribution. 

While AI can enhance your workflow, it should not be used to compensate for gaps in knowledge or experience. Evaluate all AI output for correctness, security, performance, and alignment with the project architecture. If you submit bad or sloppy work, that reflects poorly on you and could disqualify you from being considered for any of our mentorship programs. 

Our mentors are committed to helping students and contributors who want to improve their skills – be respectful of their time and talents. **DO NOT WASTE THEIR TIME** by submitting sloppy or unreviewed AI outputs as your contribution. You are more likely to make a good impression with a mentor if you submit thoughtful and well reviewed submissions that relate to the project ideas they have posted about. Be thoughtful about all the PRs or other contributions you submit – is it really helping the project? Is it really showing your capabilities? 

When submitting a proposal (including via GSoC), your full PR/contribution history will be evaluated to ensure that you have the technical expertise to complete your project. Using AI (or any other tools/cheats) to compensate for lack of necessary technical knowledge will result in your disqualification or removal from the program. 

*These guidelines were in part inspired by AI usage policy from our affiliated project [PeerSky](https://github.com/p2plabsxyz/peersky-browser?tab=contributing-ov-file#ai-usage-policy)*
